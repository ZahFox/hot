# hot

high-order tools

## ðŸ”¥ Introduction

This respository contains `hot`, a toolset to help me automate things that I do on computers. I named the project `hot` or, high-order tools, because I plan to have the library components of this project act like "glue code" for different software and operating systems. My goal is to have the library components be generic enough to be used anywhere and by anybody. However, the `hot` cli and other executables will be primarily designed for my personal workflows.
